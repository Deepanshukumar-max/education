                <p class="text-small">Many people think that life is very unfair. Here you are working hard and yet your income is not even enough to buy you an ice cream. On the other side of the coin, you know someone who does not even shed a drop of sweat and yet lies in luxury. If you think that life has been so rude on you and you were only born to suffer your destiny, then you are thinking as a poor man would think. But if you think that you are the master of your destiny and you are in total control of your life, then you have a rich man’s mentality.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is very important for all of us. Either you are a child or old, it can help you at any age. Education is a type of learning that can be achieved in your school as well as in the playground because we can learn from anywhere.

            Education can help you in many ways, as it can play a very important role in your overall development. The earnestness of your learning can also make you an all-rounder. It is not always necessary to be scientific to invent. Your knowledge and different perspectives can also make you do things in a different way.
            
            For example, it was Dr. Abdul Kalam’s way of thinking, that he imagined of a flying machine thorough a bird, discussed by his science teacher. Education helps us to broaden our imagination and promote our way of thinking.
            
            We should learn from others and develops our own thoughts and this is the correct way of learning. Every year, some sought of books are served in each class but some students understand the true essence of learning and perform in an extraordinary way. You will be told about the same football techniques every time, but some of us develop some special types and techniques and apply our imagination which leads them to success. </p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is an art of life which makes our life easy and better. We can also term education as another form of knowledge. A child is born ignorant but he learns various skills and techniques, all are various types of education.

            Evidence of education in India can be seen from the Vedic period. In Hinduism, children use to start their education from the age of 5, whereas in Buddhism it was 8 years. It is an education that inspires us well and helps us to brighten our future.
            
            Our mother is called our first teacher, she teaches us for day to day activities. Bookish knowledge only applies to our tests, and we must have some practical knowledge to live a meaningful life. Which can be learned at home or school or from anywhere. So, we can say that learning is education and age should never be an obstacle in our learning.
